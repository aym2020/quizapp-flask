        "answer": "NNY",
        "explanation": "In Azure, increasing the memory allocated to a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution, such as an Azure App Service, is typically not achieved by changing the pricing tier. Pricing tiers for PaaS services like Azure App Service primarily affect the CPU, storage, and other resource allocations, but not the memory.\nTo adjust the memory allocated to an Azure PaaS service, you typically need to choose a different service plan or instance size within the same pricing tier. Azure App Service plans, for example, come in various sizes, each with a specific combination of CPU, memory, and other resources. By selecting a different service plan or instance size, you can increase or decrease the memory available to your application.\nSo, while changing the pricing tier can affect the overall performance and resource allocation for a PaaS solution, including CPU and storage, adjusting the memory allocation typically involves selecting the right App Service Plan or instance size within the chosen tier.",

        "explanation": "Availability zones expand the level of control you have to maintain the availability of the applications and data on your VMs. Availability Zones are unique physical locations within an Azure region. Each zone is made up of one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking. To ensure resiliency, there are a minimum of three separate zones in all enabled regions. The physical separation of Availability Zones within a region protects applications and data from datacenter failures.\nWith Availability Zones, Azure offers industry best 99.99% VM uptime SLA. By architecting your solutions to use replicated VMs in zones, you can protect your applications and data from the loss of a datacenter. If one zone is compromised, then replicated apps and data are instantly available in another zone.",
