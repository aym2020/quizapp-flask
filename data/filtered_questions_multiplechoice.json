Each zone is made up of one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking. To ensure resiliency, there are a minimum of three separate zones in all enabled regions. The physical separation of Availability Zones within a region protects applications and data from datacenter failures.\nWith Availability Zones, Azure offers industry best 99.99% VM uptime SLA. By architecting your solutions to use replicated VMs in zones, you can protect your applications and data from the loss of a datacenter. If one zone is compromised, then replicated apps and data are instantly available in another zone.\nReferences:",

Administrative effort to manage the operating system of App1 must be minimized, indicating a desire for platform management. Therefore, for App1, you should use Platform as a Service (PaaS). PaaS allows you to focus on your application code while abstracting away the underlying operating system management. \n\nApp2: App2 must run interactively with the operating system of the server, which implies that you need direct access to and control over the operating system.

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "App1 to the cloud is infrastructure as a service (IaaS). The reason for this is that IaaS allows you to have greater control over the operating system, networking, and other infrastructure components, which is important when you're working with legacy applications. With IaaS, you can still use your legacy database and other existing components, while taking advantage of the scalability and cost savings offered by cloud infrastructure. Platform as a service (PaaS) and software as a service (SaaS) are not ideal for legacy applications as they may require extensive modifications to the code or may not be compatible with the existing infrastructure.

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The question states that users are located worldwide and will be downloading large video files. The video playback experience would be improved if they can download the video from servers in the same region as the users. We can achieve this by using a content deliver network.\nA content delivery network (CDN) is a distributed network of servers that can efficiently deliver web content to users. CDNs store cached content on edge servers in point-of-presence (POP) locations that are close to end users, to minimize latency.\nAzure Content Delivery Network (CDN) offers developers a global solution for rapidly delivering high-bandwidth content to users by caching their content at strategically placed physical nodes across the world. Azure CDN can also accelerate dynamic content, which cannot be cached, by leveraging various network optimizations using CDN POPs. For example, route optimization to bypass Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).\nThe benefits of using Azure CDN to deliver web site assets include:\n- Better performance and improved user experience for end users, especially when using applications in which multiple round-trips are required to load content.\n- Large scaling to better handle instantaneous high loads, such as the start of a product launch event.\n- Distribution of user requests and serving of content directly from edge servers so that less traffic is sent to the origin server.",

Azure AD Connect replaces older versions of identity integration tools such as DirSync and Azure AD Sync.\n* VPN Gateway sends encrypted traffic between an Azure virtual network and an on-premises location over the public Internet. You can also use VPN Gateway to send encrypted traffic between Azure virtual networks over the Microsoft network. A VPN gateway is a specific type of virtual network gateway.\n* Pipeline agent is machine where your build is performed. An agent is installable software that runs one job at a time.

The goal is to affect the application's availability and its ability to handle legitimate requests.\nDDoS attacks can be targeted at any endpoint that is publicly reachable through the internet.\nAzure has two DDoS service offerings that provide protection from network attacks: DDoS Protection Basic and DDoS Protection Standard.\nDDoS Basic protection is integrated into the Azure platform by default and at no extra cost.\nYou have the option of paying for DDoS Standard. It has several advantages over the basic service, including logging, alerting, and telemetry. DDoS Standard can generate reports that contain details of attempted attacks as required in this question.",

For example, consider an App Service web app that writes to Azure SQL Database. At the time of this writing, these Azure services have the following SLAs:\n- App Service web apps = 99.95%\n- SQL Database = 99.99%\nWhat is the maximum downtime you would expect for this application? If either service fails, the whole application fails. The probability of each service failing is independent, so the composite SLA for this application is 99.95% ֳ— 99.99% = 99.94%. That's lower than the individual SLAs, which isn't surprising because an application that relies on multiple services has more potential failure points.",

        "explanation": "To determine which additional resource is typically required by an Azure Virtual Machine (VM), let's look at each option:\nA. A virtual network - An Azure VM must be connected to a virtual network (VNet) to communicate with other resources within Azure or to connect to the internet, unless it's an isolated or private scenario where no external connectivity is needed.\n\nB. A service endpoint - Service endpoints provide secure and direct connectivity to Azure services over the Azure backbone network. They are not mandatory for a VM to function, but they are used to restrict access to Azure service resources to only your virtual network.\n\nC. Azure Firewall - This is a managed, cloud-based network security service that protects your Azure Virtual Network resources. It is not a mandatory resource for a VM to operate.\n\nD. A public IP address - A public IP address is not strictly required unless you need to access the VM from the internet. For internal communication within the same Azure VNet or between VNets, a public IP is not necessary.\n\nBased on this information, the resource that is typically required for a VM to operate within Azure's environment is A. a virtual network. Without a VNet, the VM would not be able to establish any network connectivity, which is fundamental for most use cases.",

        "explanation": "Predictability in the cloud lets you move forward with confidence. Predictability can be focused on performance predictability or cost predictability. Both performance and cost predictability are heavily influenced by the Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework. Deploy a solution that’s built around this framework and you have a solution that’s cost and performance are predictable.",

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The shared responsibility model applies to all the cloud service types. SaaS is the model that places the most responsibility with the cloud provider and the least responsibility with the user. In a SaaS environment you’re responsible for the data that you put into the system, the devices that you allow to connect to the system, and the users that have access. Nearly everything else falls to the cloud provider. The cloud provider is responsible for physical security of the datacenters, power, network connectivity, and application development and patching.",

        "answer": "CAB",

        "explanation": "The answer is Public Cloud. It's a tricky question but once it owns its infrastructure in the cloud, it no longer needs a data center (as on-premises), so the answer should be Public cloud. The key is \"no longer requires a data center\".",

Typically controlled by system monitoring tools, elastic computing matches the amount of resources allocated to the amount of resources actually needed without disrupting operations. With cloud elasticity, a company avoids paying for unused capacity or idle resources and doesn’t have to worry about investing in the purchase or maintenance of additional resources and equipment.",

A resource lock is a setting that you apply to a resource to prevent accidental deletion or modification of the resource. When a lock is applied to a resource, it blocks any operations that would modify or delete the resource.\n\nIf a resource lock is removed, it can leave the resource vulnerable to accidental deletion or modification. However, if the resource is associated with an Azure Blueprint, the Blueprint can automatically replace the lock to help protect the resource. This is because Azure Blueprints enforce compliance with policies and standards across multiple subscriptions, environments, and regions.",
